# Tic Tac Toe Game with Reinforcement Learning


![Alt Text](https://i.makeagif.com/media/4-24-2016/N2q-9R.gif)
This repository contains a Tic Tac Toe game that uses reinforcement learning techniques to train the game player. The ML approach uses Q-values, epsilon greedy selections, and multi-threading to learn and improve its gameplay.

## Reinforcement Learning

The code learns by playing the game multiple times and updating the Q-values based on the outcomes of the games. An epsilon greedy selection strategy is used to balance exploration and exploitation during the learning process. The learning process is multi-threaded to speed up the training.
